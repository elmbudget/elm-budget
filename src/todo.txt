LOWP:
1. Add selected account, date range, and edited transaction to url. That way the back button on mobile will work as expected
2. Logo!
3. Date range date picker option
4. For accounts select type (Credit card etc.)
5. For Categories select parent (or enter parent names)
6. Have a confirmatinon email limit once buddy has the version with this fix:
https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/pull/4439

LOGIN ASSIST:

1. Page to send email confirmation again
2. Page to reset password
3. Add links under login to send email confirmation again or reset password


UX TWEAKS:

1. Ability to resend email confirmation / what to do with email confirmations generally? 
2. Docs / Salesy website / Domain
3. If session invalid, simply treat as log out user rathe than show connectin error message.
4. No drama on a {"code":101,"error":"Object not found."} (404) for a DELETE request, just ignore as OK

SECURITY:

1. Test ACLs
2. Session expiry time setup in Parse

FUNCTIONALITY:

1. Import OFX etc. files
2. Auto categorise imported transactions based on existing transactions
3. Export to OFX etc. / JSON Backup
4. Set up budgets: FROM, TO, CATEGORY, AMOUNT, REPEAT (need to think about this)
5. Budget reporting using SVG (the fun bit!)
